# Data Analysis Using Python â€“ Real Estate Pricing

## Description

This project performs data analysis on a real estate pricing dataset using Python. It includes various data preprocessing steps, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques to gain insights into house prices.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Key Analysis Performed

- Displaying data types of each column
- Dropping unnecessary columns and summarizing statistics
- Counting unique floor values using `value_counts()`
- Boxplot visualization to detect price outliers
- Regression analysis to determine correlation with price

## Installation Instructions

1. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
   ```
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Data_Analysis_using_Python.ipynb
   ```

## Dataset

The dataset is retrieved from an external URL and loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.

## Results & Insights

- Analysis of house prices based on different factors
- Identification of statistical trends and outliers
- Visualization of correlations between variables

## Usage

Clone this repository, install dependencies, and open the notebook to explore the analysis. Modify the notebook as needed to experiment with different analyses and visualizations.
